The checks will be mailed no later than the 25th of the payment month, if the royalty is $10.00 or greater. If payment is not received for the last month of the quarter from outside retailers, a payment will be sent on the amount the Publisher has already received and the last month will be added to your next statement. Royalties for e-book are 40% of what the publisher receives after expenses, divided by the number of Authors or Chapters. Royalties for print are 40% of what the publisher receives after expenses, divided by the number of Authors or Chapters. If one Author writes more than one Chapter of the Story, then that Author will get an additional share of royalties for each Chapter.<br>
<br>

<br>
C. No royalties will be paid on any copies of the book sent for reviews, promotional purposes, advertising, or other similar purposes. No royalties will be paid on returned books. If sales in any calendar year are under $600, the Publisher may issue a 1099 at its own discretion. Payment of taxes on royalties is the sole responsibility of the Author whether or not a 1099 is issued. If a 1099 is not issued the quarterly/monthly statements can be used for tax purposes on the Author's behalf.<br>
<br>

The fees are much higher with this company and the setup costs are as follows: $75 to setup the cover and interior + $12 to be put into the Ingrams Advanced Distribution Catalogue for a total of $87. If any changes need to be made after sent to print they charge $37.50 for each change be it the interior or cover. The author royalties would be increased to 50% as the author will be sharing in the costs of the setup. With this option there is no guarantee that the stores will stock their shelves with your book, but there is a chance that they would agree with this option. Since the Author will be petitioning bookstores to stock their books, the Author would be responsible for any unsold books returned to the publishing company. If the Author chooses this option, please initial here ____.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Advertising</b><br>
<br>

Author understands without self-promotion, their work may not sell as well, if at all, as it would with self-promotion.<br>
<br>
D. Author understands that the Publisher will submit their Work to various places for reviews. A review is free advertising and gives the Author feedback on their book or writing style. Author understands that not all reviews will be positive or as high a rating as they wish. Further, Author may submit their work to review sites, but must first let the Publisher know where the books will be sent, to ensure that duplicate copies are not sent to the same place.<br>
<br>

Any title over 40,000 words will be released in e-book and trade paperback.<br>
