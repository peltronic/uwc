<h2>
What information we collect from you
</h2>
<h2>
Non-Personally-Identifying Information
</h2>
<p>
UTILITWORX, Inc. (UTW) collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
each visitor request. UTILITWORX’s purpose in collecting non-personally
identifying information is to better understand how UTW’s visitors use our
website. From time to time, UTW may release non-personally-identifying
information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
usage of its website or services. UTW also collects information like Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. UTILITWORX does not use such information to identify
its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under
the circumstances described below.
</p>
<h2>
Personally-Identifying Information
</h2>
<p>
Certain visitors to UTW’s websites choose to interact with UTILITWORX in ways
that require UTILITWORX to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that UTW gathers depends on the nature of
the interaction. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
information, with the understanding that it may prevent them from engaging in
certain site and service-related activities.
</p>
<h2>
Children’s privacy
</h2>
<p>

that we have collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take
steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
</p>
<h2>
How we use your information
</h2>
<p>
We may analyze end user data and information in the aggregate for purposes

how users are engaging with applications, site, services, and may report such
general trends publicly, without disclosing any specific end user data and
information.

request or to help us support other users. UTILITWORX may disclose nonpersonally-
identifying and personally-identifying information to contractors,
business partners, affiliated organizations, and service providers we use to
support our business or who provide services on our behalf. We may also

acquisition, sale of company assets, or other situation where customer and

and/or aggregated form with third parties for industry analysis, demographic
profiling, research, analysis and other similar purposes.
