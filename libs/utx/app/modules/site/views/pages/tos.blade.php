eligible to receive a free trial. We will not charge your account during the free

subscription fee at the beginning of your subscription and on a recurring basis
thereafter until you cancel. You will not receive a notice from us that your trial
period has ended. You must cancel your subscription before your billing
period renews to avoid the billing of the next period's fees to your account.

to the Services once those terms take effect constitutes acceptance of those
changes. This Agreement, any access to or use of the Services will be
governed by the laws of the state of California, excluding its conflict of law
provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to
any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco
County, California. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent,
and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by
either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof,
in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
breach thereof. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement without
