<h3>One Day on Earth Archive</h3>
<p><a class="" href="http://archive.onedayonearth.org" target="_blank">One Day on Earth</a> is a yearly project founded by a Santa Monica-based filmmaker. On October 10, 2010 (10/10/10), thousands of volunteers worldwide shot documenting life on that one day. The "arcive" utizlizes google maps as well as various search features to allow viewers to browse and watch the videos by location, keywords, categories, and so forth.</p>
<p>I developed the archive site from scratch based on designer's mock-ups. The site uses the Codeigniter MVC framework, and is hightly AJAX-driven in order to provide a smoother user experience. I also hand-coded the HTML and CSS to implement and match the graphic designer's specs. The LAMP-based backend is integrated with Google Maps, Vimeo Hosting API, and Ning Social Network API integration. Features include search, video comments & ratings, I18N support. I also developed or maintained a full “ecosystem” of supporting tools, such as an admin panel and a custom video uploader.

<h3>Robot Dough</h3>
<p>Robot Dough was a cutting-edge Web 2.0 stock investing site. I was hired after the orginal site was in place, and for the next year helped to build new features and optimize current ones in the Symfony MVC-based code. Some examples of features I worked on were a gamifcation-styled 'leaderboard' ranking users based on portfolio performance, a dashboard listing user “missions”, and an “equity browser” that allowed users to easily find a stock by interactively browsing a sector and industry hierarchy.</p>
